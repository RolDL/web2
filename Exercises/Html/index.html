        One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman Incorporated.

        A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.

        Batman does not have any metahuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his sharp mind and disciplined body, as well as his extensive combat and detective training. A master of virtually every form of martial arts, a brilliant tactician and a genius-level forensic scientist, Bruce also has access to his family’s fortune, which he’s used to create a near-limitless supply of advanced technology for his war on crime.
        Housed in the Batcave beneath Wayne Manor is an armada of specialized Batmobiles and Batplanes, troves of weaponry and armor and the Batcomputer, a supercomputer that links Bruce’s technology across the globe and beyond.

        Batman prides himself on being prepared for any emergency. He’s devised various fail-safes and plans for any number of potential doomsday scenarios. As the sometime leader of the Justice League and the patriarch of the Batman Family, he’s more than ready to take on whatever the universe throws at him. Armed with a utility belt full of Batarangs, a Batsuit loaded with cutting-edge technology and his own hair-trigger reflexes, Batman is ready to strike fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere.
